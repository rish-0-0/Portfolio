        I have a passion for teaching the knowledge I achieve to help my juniors
        learn faster and grow at a rate much more than mine. I have taught
        courses in my campus (BITS Pilani, Goa Campus) which involved React,
        NodeJS and MongoDB (MERN Stack). The strength of the class was 50 and my
        first teaching experience. Our campus has a CTE (Center for Technical
        Education) and I was part of that as a teacher.

        Pilani, Goa Campus. The title of the project was Using Deep Learning to
        guide Software Defined Networks. In this project I had to build a Deep
        Learning model with the data being provided by Raj Sir, using which the
        model could understand the various intricacies of the Software Defined
        Hosts, Software Defined Routers and Software Defined Sub Networks and
        easily adapt to give the least consumption of power while also taking
        into account Bandwidth and Congestion. The project involved building a
