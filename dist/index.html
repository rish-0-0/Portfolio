        Software Developer based in Bangalore. Currently a 4th year CS Student,
        studying in BITS Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus and graduating in August
        2021.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I have done multiple internships, first being in the Science Museum of
        BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus where I built a ChatBot which talks back to
        the visitors in their native language (Hindi). I used Google's
        DialogFlow API and ExpressJS and built a frontend for it using
        React-Electron and deployed it on a Raspberry Pi attatched to a USB
        microphone and an HDMI monitor. This project with the Birla Science
        Museum was in partial fulfillment of the PS-I course at BITS Pilani,
        Goa.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I have taken courses in my campus (BITS Pilani, Goa Campus) which
        involved React, NodeJS and MongoDB. The strength of the class was 50 and
        my first teaching experience.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        My second internship was at
        <a href="https://fountane.com/" class="inline-links" target="_blank"
          >Fountane</a
        >
        based in Hyderabad, India. It was a wonderful experience where I made
        <a href="#parkpoolr" class="inline-links">Parkpoolr</a> using my
        knowledge of React, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, Firebase Services. I had, as
        part of my interview and screening process, also helped in building
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.corbata.com/" class="inline-links"
          >Corbata</a
        >, an Uber Like application and was involved in the backend where I had
        written the basis of the shortest path algorithm between user and
        driver, and also performed a migration of data from the older MongoDB
        stack to the newer PostgreSQL stack for speed improvements and
        scalability. <br /><br />
        Shortly after my second internship, I got another opportunity to work
        with
        <a href="https://caarya.in/" target="_blank" class="inline-links"
          >Caarya</a
        >
        where I was at a senior level among the developers and I was heading
        multiple teams. Although this was part time (as I am still studying),
        the Corona Virus pandemic converted me to a fulltime developer where I
        actively participated in 7 projects (<a

        ). All of the projects mentioned previously, used either React,
        PostgreSQL, ExpressJS or used the Angular, PostgreSQL, ExpressJS stacks.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        My fourth and last internship was at
        <a href="https://megh.com/" class="inline-links" target="_blank"
          >Megh Computing</a
        >
        where I took up a different kind of problem as a challenge. The problem
        was to keep track of the warehouse items and the number of people
        entering and leaving the warehouse throughout the entirety of the day.
        The solution proposed was Computer Vision based and that is being built
        using Python and common computer vision deep learning models. The
        project involves a staged pipeline for detecting objects and keeping
        track of them and I have built all the pipeline stages. A browser tool
        which was also a requirement for the project for remote access to the
        server and some statistics is also being built by me. The project is an
        inhouse project as part of the internship for the company. This project
        is in partial fulfillment of the PS-II course offered at BITS Pilani,
        Goa Campus.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        Other than the projects at internships, I have done a research project
        under the guidance of my networks programming teacher, Raj Kumar at BITS
        Pilani, Goa Campus. The title of the project was Using Deep Learning to
        guide Software Defined Networks. In this project I had to build a Deep
        Learning model with the data being provided by Raj Sir, using which the
        model could understand the various intricacies of the Software Defined
        Hosts, Software Defined Routers and Software Defined Sub Networks and
        easily adapt to give the least consumption of power while also taking
        into account Bandwidth and Congestion. The project involved building a
        network controller using the POX controller and a Tensorflow Model.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I have one personal project which took a long time to achieve with the
        help of some seniors we were able to get some data and few users
        onboarded.
